# LandKrypt: Technical Architecture Deep Dive

## 1. Core System Overview
LandKrypt is a decentralized real estate investment platform combining:
- Fractional NFT ownership
- Staking-powered governance
- Time-bound development contracts
- Automated reward distribution

## 2. Key Smart Contracts

2.1 RealEstateNFT (ERC-721)
- Represents fractional property ownership
- Each NFT corresponds to 1 property
- Implements ERC-721Enumerable for efficient tracking

2.2 LandKryptStablecoin (LKUSD)
- USD-pegged stablecoin (ERC-20)
- Used for all staking and transactions
- Owner-controlled minting/burning

2.3 LandKryptStakingToken (LKST)
- Governance token (ERC-20)
- Minted 1:1 for LKUSD staked
- Voting weight in NFTDAO

2.4 NFTStaking
- Manages property acquisition pools
- Implements:
  - 0.05% daily staking rewards
  - 110% completion bonus
  - Chainlink Keeper integration

2.5 DevelopmentContract (ERC-721)
- Tracks developer obligations:
  - projectTimeframe (seconds)
  - startDate (timestamp)
  - isCompleted (bool)
- Auto-completion verification

2.6 NFTDAO
- Proposal lifecycle management:
  - Developer registration
  - Voting with LKST
  - Automatic execution
- Quorum enforcement

2.7 NFTMarketplace
- Handles NFT listings:
  - Price discovery
  - Staking contract whitelisting
  - Purchase recording

2.8 StakingFactory
- Deploys NFTStaking contracts
- Maintains registry:
  - nftToStakingContract
  - stakingContractToNFT
- Emergency NFT recovery

## 3. Reward Mechanism (Detailed)

3.1 Daily Rewards (0.05%)
Calculation:
rewards = (stakedAmount × 0.0005 × daysStaked)

Key properties:
- Time-based (not block-based)
- Claimable anytime
- Compounding requires manual claims

3.2 Completion Bonus (110%)
Trigger conditions:
1. NFT fully purchased (targetAmount reached)
2. DevelopmentContract timeframe elapsed
3. Chainlink Keeper verification

Distribution:
- Single lump-sum payment
- Paid in LKUSD
- Irreversible once distributed

## 4. Development Workflow

4.1 Proposal Submission
- Developer stakes LKUSD
- Submits proposal including:
  - Description (IPFS hash)
  - Requested ownership %
  - Project timeframe

4.2 Voting Phase
- Stakers vote with LKST
- Quadratic voting possible
- Minimum quorum requirement

4.3 Execution
- Winning proposal:
  - Mints DevelopmentContract NFT
  - Locks developer stake
  - Starts timeframe countdown

## 5. Security Architecture

5.1 Critical Protections
- Reentrancy guards on all state-changing functions
- Time-locked administrative actions
- Multi-sig for contract upgrades

5.2 Attack Mitigations
- Front-running: Deadline-based transactions
- Sybil attacks: LKST voting weight tied to stake
- Governance hijacking: Progressive decentralization

## 6. Economic Model

6.1 Token Flows
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Staker   │ ──> │ NFTStaking │ ──> │ Development │
└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └─────────────┘
    ↓                   ↓                     ↓
  LKUSD               LKST               Revenue Share

6.2 Incentive Alignment
- Stakers: Long-term holding rewarded
- Developers: On-time delivery crucial
- DAO: Active participation needed

## 7. Future Upgrade Path

7.1 Short-term (V1.1)
- Gas optimizations for mass claims
- Enhanced reward tracking UI

7.2 Medium-term (V2.0)
- Insurance pool integration
- RWA bridge for property income

7.3 Long-term (V3.0)
- Cross-chain deployment
- ZK-proofs for private voting

## 8. Conclusion

LandKrypt represents a novel synthesis of:
- Real-world asset tokenization
- Time-based DeFi mechanics
- DAO-governed development

The system's unique value propositions:
✅ Predictable reward structure
✅ Developer accountability
✅ Institutional-grade compliance hooks
